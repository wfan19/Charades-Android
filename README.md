# Charades for Android

A simple but customizable Android app for the party/team-building game Charades.

As far as I know this is also the only bilingual charades app in the world.

To use your own word bank you can change `words.csv` in `/app/src/main/assets/`. If you don't want to have Chinese or English in the word bank you can simply leave one column blank. 

To generate the CSV you could also use Excel or any other spreadsheet software.
